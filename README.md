# discord_bot
This bot is as simple as I wanted to make it while still retaining the features I wanted.

To install, first you will need python 3 and you will need to run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

In order to get the background task to properly run, you have to send the command `!move #<channel here>`

A reminder example can be seen on line 78 of `discord_bot.py`
